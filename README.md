# C++ / SFML Skeleton Project

That's it: A SFML C++ project. Based on, and requires `CMake`. Also requires a C++ compiler and the SFML library (obviously). This project has been tested and built successfully using `g++` and `clang++`.

Recommended compilation command: `cmake -H. -Bbuild`. This will build the project in the `{ProjectRoot}/build` directory instead of the project root.
